# Customer-Segmentation-Project
"RFM-based clustering and analysis using Online Retail dataset"
## Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis & Sales Forecasting in E-Commerce
This project focuses on **Customer Segmentation** using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** and **KMeans clustering** on an e-commerce dataset.
The goal is to identify customer groups based on their purchase behavior to support targeted marketing strategies.
## Project Overview
**Dataset**: Online Retail II dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository
**Techniques Used**:
1. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
2. RFM Scoring
3. KMeans Clustering (with Elbow Method)
4. Customer Group Profiling
**Tools**: 
Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib
## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the '.ipynb' notebook
2. Install required packages:
## pip install -r requirements.txt
# Open the Jupyter Notebook:
Run the notebook step-by-step. Make sure your Python version is **3.9.7**
## Files in the Repository
1. 'customer_segmentation_rfm_kmeans.ipynb' — main project notebook
2. 'requirements.txt' — package versions used
3. 'README.md' — this file
## Results
The KMeans model segmented the customers into clusters based on:
1. **Recency** (days since last purchase)
2. **Frequency** (number of orders)
3. **Monetary** (total spending)
These segments help identify loyal customers, at-risk customers, and high spenders.
## Requirements
1. Python 3.9.7
2. See 'requirements.txt' for full list of packages and versions.
